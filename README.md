## Overview

PUSSY is an ERC20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain. The project was founded on the idea that strong community foundation and goals are the fundamental building blocks of any token.

Ideas being currently pursued by the developers include a Pussy DAO, Arcade, Farming, Faucet, Studio, and charity partnerships.
